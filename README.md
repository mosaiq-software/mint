# Mint
Mint is a digital compositing tool for the web. It can be used to crop and resize images, create collages, build mockups, or otherwise complete basic compositing tasks. It supports image manipulation, drawings, text, and basic shapes. Mint is built as a static website, meaning it can be easily hosted locally or used as an internal tool.

Mint was created by [Sam Randa](https://github.com/notsoli) for [Mosaiq Software](https://mosaiq.dev/).

## Technologies
Mint uses the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) for its core rendering engine, [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) for its user interface, and [Melt UI](https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui) for interface components.
